#### Goals
* Collect data at 25C for PS312, ttx-1, gcy-8.1/8.2, che-1, and die-1

#### Future Goals for Thermotaxis
* Get Cel-ttx-1 mutant strain for testing direct comparison with Ppa-ttx-1.
* Find a way to record tracks of worms during thermotaxis


#### Additional Notes
* Need to test BIG (15cm) plates for thermotaxis
* Perhaps this may be useful for measuring thermotaxis tracks: "A 47-mm black MF-Millipore membrane (0.45 mm pore size) was applied to the surface of the agar to record the tracks of the worms (Granzer and Haas, 1991). [...] Larvae leave an easily visible reflective track on the otherwise dull, nonreflective surface of the Millipore membrane, when viewed at 103 magnification, also visible with the naked eye. The tracks were photographed with a 35-mm camera fitted with a ringlight electronic flash." (Li et al. 2000; DOI: 10.1002/1096-9861(20000814)424:1<58::aid-cne5>3.0.co;2-z) - the only issue I can think of is that loading worms with eyelashes may leave unwanted traces in the membrane, and we instead may have to load worms via washing if we were to use this method.
